# Mackinnon_Jack_MidTerm
 
# This is my attempt at building mockup site for Peroni X Tilex collaboration.

# This presented me many challenges, including Git-Hub wiping my folder clean once.

# But overall I am proud of the way it turned out, along with the whole mid-term.
# I felt as though with the time given and the massive Mid-Term, I performed well and made work I am proud of.

# Thanks for the semester so far! Here's to the rest.

# Used Adobe color swatches.
# Along with eyedrop samples.
